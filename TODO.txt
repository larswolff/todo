Now we need to work on the dashboard. We are using Tailwind CSS. The first part is to create a global menu when logged in, this menu links to the major pages in the app. These pages do not exists yet - dont create them! The menu should be a column at the left side of the screen, and the visiblilty should be togglable like a hamburger menu. At md at lower the menu should be hidden by default, and on bigger screen it should default to visible. The column should be full height and have a different background color than the Detail/page area. It should be with limited to something reasonable. The active menu item in the menu should be highlighed even at subpages. To clarify, "Projects" should be highlighted both at /projects and at /project/1. Here are the items for the menu:

Inbox - new tasks without a project
Today - ready tasks with defer or due date set to today or in the past
Next - all tasks with status next
Projects - all projects
Areas - All areas, like "Private"
Tags - all tags
Review - projects and tags ready for review
Waiting - Task with status waiting
Upcoming - Tasks in the future
Someday - tasks and projects with status "Someday"
--
Lastly the name field from all the Tag models that has in_menu true
